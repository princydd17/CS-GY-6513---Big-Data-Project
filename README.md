# CS-GY-6513: Big Data Project - Analysis and Prediction of Stock Prices Using Yahoo Finance Dataset


## Abstract
Stock price prediction is crucial for financial analysis, helping investors and institutions make informed decisions. The vast and constantly evolving nature of stock market data makes prediction challenging. Stock prices change rapidly, generating massive amounts of real-time data, while historical records spanning years or decades contribute millions of data points per stock.

Traditional forecasting methods struggle with the market's complexity and volatility. They are computationally slow, inefficient with large datasets, and often fail to capture the non-linear patterns that drive stock price movements. With data covering thousands of stocks over long periods, traditional approaches also face scalability issues and miss critical indicators, reducing accuracy and increasing prediction errors.

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based predictive model for stock price forecasting, leveraging historical stock data from Yahoo Finance. By utilizing advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques, the project seeks to improve stock price predictionâ€™s accuracy and provide investors with valuable insights.
